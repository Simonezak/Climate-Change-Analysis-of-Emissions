# Climate Change: Analysis of Emissions and their Relationship to GDP
The objective of this project is to analyze the emissions from various countries around the world between 2000 and 2020 and predict future emissions and compare Emissions and GDP.

The repository presents the code used for the project and the final presentation.

Some of the analyses performed in this project are:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression
- Classification (Low to High Emission Countries)
- Correlation Total Emissions with GDP
- Time Series Prediction
